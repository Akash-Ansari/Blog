Welcome to my blog! I am a biostatistician with a keen interest in statistics, deep learning, and programming. This blog is a chronicle of my personal and professional journey as I explore these fascinating fields.

<!-- I hope that this blog will not only serve as a record of my growth and development but also inspire and educate others who share my passion for data-driven decision-making. I welcome feedback, questions, and suggestions from my readers, so please don't hesitate to get in touch or leave a comment on my posts. -->

<!-- Thank you for joining me on this exciting adventure, and I look forward to sharing my insights and experiences with you! -->
